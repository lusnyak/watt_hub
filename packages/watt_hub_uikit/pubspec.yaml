# To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
  fonts:
    - family: Urbanist
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/urbanist/Urbanist-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
